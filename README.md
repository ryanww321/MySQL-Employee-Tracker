# MySQL-Employee-Tracker

Built a database schema with a command-line application that allows a user to add departments, roles, & employees. To view departments, roles, & employees.  And the ability to be able to update employee roles.

How I built this:

Used the MySQL NPM package to connect to my MySQL database and perform queries.


Used Inquirers NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.


Used console.table to print MySQL rows to the console.
